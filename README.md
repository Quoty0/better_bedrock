## Installation
- these app packages are considered "untrusted" by Windows, because they were packaged by a 3rd party (me)
- in order to install the appx's certificate, double click it
- select the `Store Location` to be `Local Machine`, then click `Next`
- select `Place all certificates in the following store` and set the directory to the `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` folder
- click `Next`, then `Finish`
- double click the appx to install with the default App Installer
- note: if you do not trust these steps, feel free to unzip the appx into a folder and repackage it yourself with the tool below, or install in extracted format with powershell
